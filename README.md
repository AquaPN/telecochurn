# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Welcome to the **Telecom Customer Churn Analysis** project! This repository focuses on understanding customer churn behavior in a telecom company by analyzing user data from a **business-oriented perspective**. The goal is not just technical model building but to provide **actionable business insights** through data-driven exploration.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Churn — the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity — is a key metric in the telecom sector. Reducing churn directly improves revenue and customer lifetime value.

In this project:

- We analyze telecom customer data to identify **key patterns and drivers of churn**.
- A deep **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** has been conducted to highlight trends, correlations, and churn indicators.
- The next phase will involve building and evaluating **machine learning models** to predict churn, backed by business reasoning.
- The end objective is to **bridge the gap between data science and business strategy**.

## 🧠 Key Insights from EDA (So Far)

- Customers with **monthly contracts** tend to churn more than those with longer contracts.
- High churn is observed among customers with **electronic check payments** and **no internet security services**.
- Features like **tenure**, **monthly charges**, and **contract type** show strong correlation with churn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook  
- *(Upcoming)* Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit (or Dash) for business dashboards

## 🎯 Business Perspective

This project is structured to simulate how a **telecom business analyst or product manager** would approach churn prediction:

- Understand the pain points  
- Use data to validate business hypotheses  
- Convert analysis into **recommendations** and **strategic interventions**
